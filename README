Maze Generator
Copyright (C) 2009-2018 Matthew T. Pandina. All rights reserved.

This is a Qt 5 front-end to a very portable (and memory efficient) C
program I wrote to create and solve N-dimensional* mazes of any size.

It uses a randomized Kruskal's algorithm to generate the mazes, and
solves them using a dead-end filling algorithm.

You can configure the size and look of the mazes, save them as image
files, or print them out (or save them as PDF files) with or without
their solutions.

*This GUI only allows 2D mazes to be visualized.


To build under Debian GNU/Linux:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential qtcreator qt5-default

Next, using Qt Creator, open the MazeGenerator.pro file, set the build
type to 'Release' and build it.
