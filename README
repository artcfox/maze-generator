Maze Generator
Copyright (C) 2009-2018 Matthew T. Pandina. All rights reserved.

This is a multi-threaded Qt 5 front-end to a very portable (and memory
efficient) C program I wrote to create and solve N-dimensional* mazes
of any size.

It uses a randomized Kruskal's algorithm to generate the mazes, and
solves them using a dead-end filling algorithm.

You can configure the size and look of each maze, export as a BMP
file, print to paper, or a PDF file.

*This GUI only allows 2D mazes to be visualized.


To build under Debian GNU/Linux:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential qtcreator qt5-default
git clone https://github.com/artcfox/maze-generator
cd maze-generator
qtcreator MazeGenerator.pro

Set the build type to 'Release' and build it.
